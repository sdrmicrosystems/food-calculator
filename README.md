## 1. Functionalities

### 1.1 Get all products
Return the products as a list. 
Use the following curl `curl -v localhost:8081/products` or Swagger-UI (see point 5) to access the end-point.

### 1.2 Create a new product
Use this functionality to create the products.
Use the below curl or Swagger-UI (see point 5) to access the end-point.
`curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/json" --data-binary "{\"name\": \"test\", \"description\": \"test\", \"price\": 10}" http://localhost:8081/products`

### 1.3 Get the product by id
Return the product by ID value.
Use the following curl `curl -v localhost:8081/products/99` or Swagger-UI (see point 5) to access the end-point.

### 1.4 Update the product by id and new product's details
Use this functionality to create the products.
Use the below curl or Swagger-UI (see point 5) to access the end-point.
`curl -X PUT -H "Content-type:application/json" --data-binary "{\"name\": \"test updated\", \"description\": \"test updated\", \"price\": 10}" http://localhost:8081/products/37`

### 1.5 Delete the product by id
Delete the product by ID value.
Use the following curl `curl -X DELETE localhost:8081/products/1` or Swagger-UI (see point 5) to access the end-point.

## 2. Getting Started

Clone or download a copy of this project.

### 2.1 Prerequisites

This project requires Java 11, Maven and at least one database (PostgreS, H2, MySql).
Please, see `SecurityConfig` class for more information.
WARN: If no security config then change the value from `spring.security.user.password` property. User `user` value as default username.

### 2.2 Database installation

#### 2.2.1 H2
No installation is required.
The `spring.datasource.url` is the one required property which should be set. By default, the
username is `sa` with empty password. Two modes: in memory and file storage. See the `application.properties`
file for more details related configuration.

#### 2.2.2 MySQL

```
CREATE DATABSE stm;
```

Note: in case that you run the application starting with MySQL 8.0.4, please execute the following query:
```
ALTER USER '${USER}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '${PASSWORD}';
-- where ${USER} and ${PASSWORD} should be provided. 
```

#### 2.2.3 Postgres
Install PostgreSQL. It is required to create a database:

Please, run the following commands if it is the case:
```
createuser -U postgres -s Progress
```

Please, run the following command to import a database (if it is the case):
```
pg_restore -d DATABASE_NAME <  PATH/BACKUP_FILE_NAME.sql
```

To create the JAR file please use the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```

## 3. Running the tests
Find all project test into `src/test/java` path. Per overall description:
- `com.fc.controller` contains all integration tests
- `com.fc.service` contains all unit tests
- `com.fc.utils` util class for testing propose
## 4. Deployment
If the build (the jar file) is ready then the application can be run. Please, use the following command to run the application:
```
XXX:food-calculator xxx java -jar target/food-calculator-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### 4.1 Deployment & run on LINUX environment
In case if application is run in a linux based instance, please create the following folders:
1. /app         - folder where the JAR is located;
2. /app/log     - folder which will contains the logs;
3. /app/config  - folder which will contains the application configuration files;
4. /app/file-db - production or working folder where service will save physically the content;
5. /app/test-db - test folder where service will save physically the content;

To run the application we have the following options:
```
nohub java -jar food-calculator-1.0.0.jar --spring.config.location=/app/config/application.properties &
```

To show last NUM_OF_RECORDS from a FILE_NAME linux command:
```
tail -n NUM_OF_RECORDS FILE_NAME
```

### 4.2 Deployment & run on WINDOWS environment
The application was developed on Windows environment.

To run application, please run this command:
```
java -jar /projects/app/food-calculator-1.0.0.jar --spring.config.location=/projects/app/config/application.properties
```

## 5. Swagger usage
This will automatically deploy swagger-ui to a spring-boot application:
Documentation will be available in HTML format, using the official swagger-ui jars
The Swagger UI page will then be available at `http://server:port/context-path/swagger-ui.html` and the OpenAPI description will be available at the following url for json format:`http://server:port/context-path/v3/api-docs`
- `server` The server name or IP
- `port` The server port
- `context-path` The context path of the application (if exist)

To access the Swagger UI, please use the following links:
-  ``http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html``
-  ``http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html``
